# DatePicker
AngularJS ReUseable UI-Bootstrap Datepicker Directive

Ok so this has helped me out a lot but it may need to be modified for anyone elses purposes. I put my add ons before the input field and the class for the calender icon is part of the project it is in but can be replaced with the correct font awesome class.
